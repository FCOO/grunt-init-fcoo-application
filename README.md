git clone https://github.com/fcoo/grunt-init-fcoo-application.git "%USERPROFILE%/.grunt-init/fcoo-application"
```
or see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path

2.	Clone the new repository to your computer/Desktop 
3.	Open a command-prompt and go to the directory with the new (empty) repository
4.	Run the command below and follow the prompts
